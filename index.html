	<h2>What was most challenging about the project?</h2>
	The most challenging part of project 1 was the trial and error component. I haven't had a lot of experience with responsive design coding so I was constantly editing the code with percentages and minimizing and maximizing the screen in order to see how to website worked on a laptop, then on a mobile device. It wasn't extremely difficult to code but it took a lot of time with trial and error in order to perfect the layout. Making the navbar responsive was probably the hardest part for me. I made the navbar absolute in the css in order for the body to not run over the top of the navbar. I'm not sure if it is responsive or not, but when I minimize the screen it stays in the same spot. I also had to google around in order to find out how to make the background responsive. It took me a few times before I figured it out.

	<h2>Did you use any resources?</h2>
	Yes I used quite a few resources. In order to get the grid based layout, I used responsivegridsystem.com. I entered the amount of rows and columns I desired and the website generated the code. Even though I copy and pasted the code, I still had to heavily edit the html and css to make it look like I wanted. This website was a good resource to save time and helped me understand grid based layouts better. I also incorporated google fonts and used the bootstrap website for coding purposes. For most of my help, I just googled what I needed and used random websites with trial and error in order to get my desired result. In order to make page 1 with the images, I used your example that you provided on your website. It took me longer than I thought to tweak the code and figure out how to make it work for my photographs. I struggled with all the divs at first and forgot to close some to it was quite a mess! However, I was able to understand columns and rows and how to lay photographs on a page.

	<h2>How would you improve a portion of this project?</h2>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	I tried to implement the hamburger icon when the page goes to mobile. I commented things out and tried to get it to work, however, the icon would never show up and I would still get a list. I wish I could have implemented this aspect because I feel like with mobile it's important to have that icon since it's so popular and user friendly. There was JavaScript included with the code for the hamburger, and I'm not too hot with JavaScript, so maybe that's where I messed up! I know in class we discussed the @ symbol and could only do the hamburger for mobile but still after googling around I couldn't quite grasp how to implement the code correctly. The last thing I would change is the h1 on my page 1. For some reason I could not figure out why the h1 wasn't the same as the index page or page 2. I had the style.css link on the last of every html page in order to overide the other links, so I was really thrown trying to figure it out. I commented out the skeleton link and it returned to normal. How am I supposed to incorporate the skeleton link if it changes my text? Not sure. (I added the skeleton link to every page now it all looks the same. Not sure if that is correct coding? However it resolves the problem.)
